# 1
# Given a list, write a Python program to swap first and last element of the list.
# Examples: 
# Input : [12, 35, 9, 56, 24]
# Output : [24, 35, 9, 56, 12]

# Input : [1, 2, 3]
# Output : [3, 2, 1]


# 2
# Given a list in Python and provided the positions of the elements, write a program to swap the two elements in the list.

# Examples:  
# Input : List = [23, 65, 19, 90], pos1 = 1, pos2 = 3
# Output : [19, 65, 23, 90]

# Input : List = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], pos1 = 2, pos2 = 5
# Output : [1, 5, 3, 4, 2]


#3
# Python | Find the length of a string wihtout using len method


#4
#Define a function which takes dictionary as an argument and print sorted dictionary by key first
# and then a value

# Example
# {"python" : 5, "javascript" : 10, "c#": 9, "golang" : 3, "java" : 1}
# First print statement should be sorted based on key (alphabetical)
# Second print statement should be sorted based on values (numerical)

#6 Define a function to convert number to words for upto four digit. Note that you can use any package or library.
# Every word should be defined by you
# Example -- int2_word(5) --> five
# int2_word(999) ---> Nine hundred ninety nine
# int2_word(9992) ---> nine thousand nine hundred ninety two
